# LUA-Code
A small collection of programs written while learning LUA, nothing of interest to the advanced user here, but someone just learning may find it interesting. It's mainly just a way to organize programs.

# Why LUA?
I recently discovered LUA while researching how to write a script/mod for The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind. All mods are written with LUA with the [Morrowind Script Extender](https://mwse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lua/type/tes3iterator.html). I quickly realized though that LUA was even easier than Python to learn and so decided to run with it. I'm working through [Programming in LUA](https://github.com/wudeng/ebook/blob/master/Programming.in.Lua.4th.Edition.2016.8.pdf) which is the most popular book to work through to learn LUA. LUA is used in [so many projects](http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaUses), but specifically popular in the video game industry.
